# Dummy Instagram Database
- Developed ER diagram to combine tables and defined one-to-many and many-to-many relationships in its relational schema
- On applying full outer join, a database consisting 380 observations could be visualized to subsequently apply CRUD operations
- To select the users who had liked every picture, formulated a sub-query analogous to division operator in relational algebra

Instagram database
- Created 7 tables: users, photos, comments, likes, follows, tags and photo_tags in the database
- The tables are connected using foreign keys and references
